# Marlin-based 3D Printer Firmware for Homero 3D Printer
![Homero 3D](../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/homero.png)
 I bought an [HTA3D P3S-2E printer](https://www.hta3d.com/es/kit-p3steel-dual) (based on the P3 Steel) that I have heavily modified. I called this variant *Homero 3d* in honor to my dog.

This repository contains the firmware source code, which is based on [Marlin](http://marlinfw.org)
